# Day Planner
- In this project, I created a scheduler for a current work day.

## Overview
- This application sets the current day at the top and provides
time blocks for every hour between 9:00 and 5:00.
- These time blocks are color coded based on whether that hour is
in the past, present, or future.

## Usage
- Each block is also a text input box with a save button attached
to it. Users can input tasks for a certain time block and save the 
text.
- These events are saved in local storage and repopulated upon the
page loading.
